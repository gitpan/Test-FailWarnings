NAME
    Test::FailWarnings - Add test failures if warnings are caught

VERSION
    version 0.001

SYNOPSIS
    Test file:

        use strict;
        use warnings;
        use Test::More;
        use Test::FailWarnings;

        ok( 1, "first test" );
        ok( 1 + "lkadjaks", "add non-numeric" );

        done_testing;

    Output:

        ok 1 - first test
        not ok 2 - Caught warning
        #   Failed test 'Caught warning'
        #   at t/bin/main-warn.pl line 7.
        # Warning was 'Argument "lkadjaks" isn't numeric in addition (+) at t/bin/main-warn.pl line 7.'
        ok 3 - add non-numeric
        1..3
        # Looks like you failed 1 test of 3.

DESCRIPTION
    This module hooks $SIG{__WARN__} and converts warnings to Test::More's
    "fail()" calls. It is designed to be used with "done_testing", when you
    don't need to know the test count in advance.

    Just as with Test::NoWarnings, this does not catch warnings if other
    things localize $SIG{__WARN__}, as this is designed to catch *unhandled*
    warnings.

SEE ALSO
    *   Test::NoWarnings -- catches warnings and reports in an "END" block.
        Not (yet) friendly with "done_testing".

    *   Test::Warn -- test for warnings without triggering failures from
        this modules
